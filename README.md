# worldbuilding
This repository is part of my experiment with worldbuilding. Its primary purpose is the storage of ideas and resources, but it also serves as a public face for the project.
# library
A website is hosted from repository acting as a private 'Library' into all current known knowledge of this built world. I aim for the site to hold books written from the perspective of explorers, books written by the people's they encountered, images of artifacts, works of literature, treatises etc.
